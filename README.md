Finally a good package manager for swift.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE:
This repository has been archived since we found some swift package managers that
already do all of what we aimed to do. You can check them out here:

## Installation:
Download with `git clone https://github.com/Xenthio/swip.git`

Then run `make`, if you don't have make installed, install it.
